# Analysis-of-Gender-Inequality-Factors-using-Python


The project aims at utilizing python libraries to explore factors affecting gender disparities in health, empowerment and the labor market. The Gender inequality index(GII) is a composite measure, reflecting inequality in achievements between women and men in these three dimensions.

* Data is sourced from World Data Bank, Census, and US Bureau of Labor Force Statistics. Multiple datasets were available in excel format and extensive cleaning and merging was performed for analysis and drawing insights.
* The data was narrowed down to include five countries depending on their development indicators.
The least developed nations - Yemen and Afghanistan; developing nations - India and Azerbaijan; developed nations - United States.
* Some analysis made around these factors:
  1. Women reproductive health
  2. Women empowerment in Parliament
  3. Labor market share 
  4. Gender wage gap
  5. Fertility rate analysis,
  6. School enrollment statistics

* Conclusion:
Secondary education provided for females can lead to improvement in terms of maternal mortality and adolescent fertility. Wage difference analysis suggests that women sacrifice their careers and dedicate time to childcare, whereas men’s employment trend stays almost unaffected.
Furthermore, analysis of the trend of high-earning males in certain occupations remains unchanged, and only 3-4% of occupations for women are paid higher than men. Strengthening the collective power of women in leadership is perhaps the answer to bridging gaps.
The world has an average of 25% women’s share in parliament seats. It is a hopeful sign that there will be an increase in the coming years, and the world will move towards lower disparities between genders.

* Skills used:
  Python libraries: Altair for visualization, Pandas for data cleaning, Geopandas for map based analysis and Matplotlib. 

### Note: The project contains interactive plots created using Altair(python lib for visualization) that cannot be rendered in GitHub. Screenshots of those visuals are added to this repository.
