The project aims at exploring factors affecting gender disparities in health, empowerment and the labor market using Python. The Gender inequality index(GII) is a composite measure, reflecting inequality in achievements between women and men in these three dimensions.

* Data is sourced from World Data Bank, Census, and US Bureau of Labor Force Statistics. Multiple datasets were available in excel format and extensive cleaning and merging was performed for analysis and drawing insights.
* The data was narrowed down to include five countries depending on their development indicators.
The least developed nations - Yemen and Afghanistan; developing nations - India and Azerbaijan; developed nations - United States.

Some analysis made around these factors:

1. Women reproductive health
2. Women empowerment in Parliament
3. Labor market share 
4. Gender wage gap
5. Fertility rate analysis,
6. School enrollment statistics 

* Skills:
Python libraries: Altair for visualization, Pandas for data cleaning, Geopandas for map based analysis and Matplotlib. 



Note: The project contains interactive plots created using Altair(python lib for visualization) that cannot be rendered in GiHub. Screenshots of those visuals are added to this repository.
